  When I made this game, I divide the process into 3 part below:
  <ol>
    <li>Get the word that will be guessed by player <br>
      I get the words from github repo simply by put the link of the txt file inside the ``getWords1.py`` and it will be saved as a list
    <li>The game flow <br>
    <li>Chance Visualization <br>
      
  <ol>
