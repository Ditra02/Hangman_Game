When I made this game, I divide the process into 3 part below:
1. Get the word that will be guessed by player <br>
   I get the words from github repository simply by put the link of the txt file inside `getWords1.py` and it will be opened by urllib. Finally, the words saved as a list. You can see the implementation in [getWords](https://github.com/Ditra02/Hangman_game/tree/main/getWord) file.

2.
